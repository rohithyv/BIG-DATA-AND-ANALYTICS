📊 Email Network Graph Analysis – EU Email Dataset
Course: CS6444 – Big Data and Analytics
Semester: Spring 2025
Tools: R, igraph, Network Analysis, Graph Theory

📁 Overview
This project explores the Email-EU dataset, which models the email interactions between EU institutions as a directed graph. Using the igraph package in R, we imported, cleaned, visualized, and analyzed the network to uncover key structural and statistical insights.
